        <p>We must look after forests so they look after us </p>
        <p>The World Bank also supports large-scale sustainable forest and land use programs, such as the Forest Carbon
            Partnership Facility and the BioCarbon Fund Initiative for Sustainable Forest Landscapes. These initiatives,
            which work across more than 50 countries, have to date unlocked over $180 million for results-based payments
            for emission reductions, incentivizing countries to scale up sustainable forest management to help achieve
            global climate targets. What’s more, through PROGREEN, a new global partnership for sustainable and
            resilient landscapes, the World Bank is scaling up support to help countries invest in forests to improve
            livelihoods, reverse biodiversity loss, and tackle climate change in an integrated and cost-effective
            manner. </p>
        <p>Healthy forests provide critical ecosystem services important to nature, people and economies, including the
            provision of drinking water, water and climate cycle regulation, erosion prevention, crop pollination, soil
            fertility, and flood control. Forests, especially rainforests, are also vital habitats for biodiversity</p>
        <p>Fueled in part by unsustainable land use, about one million animal and plant species are now threatened with
            extinction, many within decades. Forest protection and sustainable land use remains one of our best options
            to limit this biodiversity loss. The World Bank continues to work with countries to put policies in place so
            that biodiversity is valued as essential for sustainable development. The Bank’s forest and land use
            emission reductions programs also help to restore healthy ecosystems for a healthy planet.</p>
